You are an AI Architect building a futuristic, real-time AI-powered IDE platform that surpasses VS Code, Replit, Cursor, and Bolt in every dimension. Design and implement a full-fledged AI-based IDE that:

üåê MULTI-LANGUAGE & CROSS-PLATFORM SUPPORT:
- Supports 500+ programming languages with auto-detection and syntax highlighting.
- Real-time code conversion between languages (e.g., Java ‚Üí Python, C++ ‚Üí Go, JS ‚Üí Rust).
- Cross-platform compatibility: web, desktop (Electron), and mobile IDEs.

ü§ñ AI & MULTI-MODEL INTEGRATION:
- Integrate and orchestrate multiple AI models: OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Mistral, Flash, and open-source LLMs (LLaMA3, Mixtral).
- Smart routing of tasks to best-suited model (e.g., Gemini for web UI, GPT for codegen, Claude for documentation).
- AI Plugin Marketplace: installable plugins for code review, test generation, refactoring, AI pair programming, and domain-specific models.

üßë‚Äçüíª FRONTEND UI/UX (MODERN DEV EXPERIENCE):
- Split-pane UI (code + AI assistant + console + file tree).
- Monaco Editor (VS Code engine) or custom WASM-based editor.
- Multi-tab editing, auto-save, version control (Git), and AI chat dock.
- Theme manager, accessibility features, and drag-drop UI builder.
- Real-time team collaboration with shared cursors (like Google Docs/Live Share).
- Terminal emulator, web preview, and browser sandbox.
- Voice-activated commands & real-time AI voice assistant.

üß± BACKEND CAPABILITIES:
- Use **Node.js** and **Python** together via orchestrated microservices.
- REST, WebSocket & GraphQL API exposure for frontend IDE functions.
- AI model inference orchestration, load balancing, autoscaling.
- Real-time backend debugging & sandboxed execution per user.
- File storage, code execution sandbox (Docker or Firecracker VM).
- Git integration, cloud syncing (Dropbox, GDrive, GitHub).
- Secure serverless deploys (AWS Lambda, Vercel, etc.) on button click.

üì¶ FULL SDLC & PROJECT LIFECYCLE:
- End-to-End Project Creation: From one-line idea ‚Üí full working app.
- Auto-generate: UI, backend APIs, DB schema, test cases, docs.
- Live preview, test suites, CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfile, and Helm charts.
- Generate APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI & Postman collections.
- Add README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore, and LICENSE files.

üß™ TESTING & DEPLOYMENT:
- AI-generated unit, integration, and E2E test cases with real-time execution.
- Support for Jest, Mocha, Pytest, Selenium, Cypress, etc.
- AI debugger: auto-detect errors & generate fixes or bug reports.
- One-click deploy to Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure.
- Live logs, analytics dashboard, performance monitoring.

üîÑ INTEGRATION ECOSYSTEM:
- Connect to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket for repo sync.
- Integrate with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Pinecone, Weaviate.
- Support for external APIs: Stripe, Twilio, Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB, MySQL.
- Plugin API for developers to create & publish AI-powered IDE tools.

üß† LEARNING & ASSISTANCE:
- Step-by-step code walkthroughs & guided learning modules.
- AI Tutor Mode: ask questions, get visual explanations.
- Smart documentation generator, diagram creator (UML, ERD).
- Smart autocomplete, inline explanation, auto-refactor, and code comments.

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY & USER MANAGEMENT:
- Role-based access control (RBAC), user/org/team support.
- Data encryption, audit logging, code vaults.
- Real-time DDoS protection and AI anomaly detection.

üíº BUSINESS & SAAS ENABLEMENT:
- User management, billing, usage tracking, quota limits.
- Custom IDE instance per org (white-labeling possible).
- Subscription models with AI credit usage & plugin stores.
